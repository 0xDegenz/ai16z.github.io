I don't quite understand how to do what you're saying for `packages/client-twitter/src/index.ts` but agree there too.\r\n\r\nAfter talking to Shaw about this PR a few nights ago I think I'll have to scrap it and refactor with `ACTION` first thinking.\r\n\r\nI'm paraphrasing what he actually said but: \"Shaw strongly believes image generation should be an action the agent can take. He wants it to be driven by the agent's decision-making process, not chance. The aim is for the image generation to be handled within the agent, not the Twitter client\"\r\n\r\nThere were a few things he said needed to be done. One of them a `none` action handler to better manage actions and responses.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind I'm going to close this and revisit later with better logic.",
