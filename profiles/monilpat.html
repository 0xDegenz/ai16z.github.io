It looks like we're using a workaround instead of the `{ generateObject }` method from `\"ai\"`, which natively supports Z objects and ensures typing. This could be more reliable than the current method of using `generateText` to generate, parse, and retry until we get the desired output.\r\n\r\nUsing `{ generateObject }` would allow us to eliminate the custom `generateObject` and `generateObjectArray` functions, simplifying the code and leveraging the AI SDK's structured output capabilities. Here’s the code as it stands now:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport async function generateObject({\r\n    runtime,\r\n    context,\r\n    modelClass,\r\n}: {\r\n    runtime: IAgentRuntime;\r\n    context: string;\r\n    modelClass: string;\r\n}): Promise<any> {\r\n    if (!context) {\r\n        elizaLogger.error(\"generateObject context is empty\");\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n    let retryDelay = 1000;\r\n\r\n    while (true) {\r\n        try {\r\n            const response = await generateText({\r\n                runtime,\r\n                context,\r\n                modelClass,\r\n            });\r\n            const parsedResponse = parseJSONObjectFromText(response);\r\n            if (parsedResponse) {\r\n                return parsedResponse;\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (error) {\r\n            elizaLogger.error(\"Error in generateObject:\", error);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, retryDelay));\r\n        retryDelay *= 2;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to replace it with the `generateObject` function provided in the AI SDK, as described below:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n/**\r\nGenerate JSON with any schema for a given prompt using a language model.\r\n\r\nThis function does not stream the output. If you want to stream the output, use `streamObject` instead.\r\n\r\n@returns\r\nA result object that contains the generated object, the finish reason, the token usage, and additional information.\r\n*/\r\ndeclare function generateObject(options: Omit<CallSettings, 'stopSequences'> & Prompt & {\r\n    output: 'no-schema';\r\n    model: LanguageModel;\r\n    mode?: 'json';\r\n    experimental_telemetry?: TelemetrySettings;\r\n    experimental_providerMetadata?: ProviderMetadata;\r\n    _internal?: {\r\n        generateId?: () => string;\r\n        currentDate?: () => Date;\r\n    };\r\n}): Promise<GenerateObjectResult<JSONValue>>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitching to this method would improve reliability and reduce custom parsing logic.
